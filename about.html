            Marty Plaskon is a 21-year-old emerging Canadian 
            artist who began releasing music under the name “parallel” in 2020. 
            While the early days of “parallel” were based in just production, 
            Marty has elevated the project to new heights in just a year. Since 2024, 
            Marty has taught himself to play the guitar, performed his first live show, 
            and solidified musical partnerships with prominent indie artists while studying in Montreal. 
            <br> <br> This success has seen his streaming numbers climb, with his collab with link3, 
            <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/1LMYS2t6qlFZrmzZmqOP0F?si=904f7e41e7ad47f2" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> "Renfrew Avenue"</a>, 
            reaching 70k streams, his collab with Total, 
            <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/4uTmwrzuMMZlTuQ0Cnrh7u?si=52814f1cf2cb4541" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> "forest"</a>,  reaching 14k streams, and with opening for 
            <a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/5r5uCVk3IIzm2jdfGDpl8C?si=YNw87CjiRGKl3_kzl8Phvg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Beach Vacation</a>.

            He also opened for link3 on their mini-world tour. While “parallel” has undergone a major evolution 
            in the past year, there are many strings that tie the 5-year-long project together. 
            Marty has been deeply influenced by the melancholic themes and lush, ambient textures of King Krule, 
            Mac DeMarco, and Dean Blunt. Inspired by these artists’ deep involvement in their music, 
            Marty has written, recorded, mixed, and mastered all of his music from his bedroom. 
            Through “parallel,” Marty has always explored introspective and emotionally raw themes 
            through reverb-soaked indie, slowcore, and lo-fi rock. <br> <br> Marty’s passion for vulnerability 
            stems from his desire to make a positive impact on mental health awareness and to foster 
            meaningful connections through music.
